# Carton Packaging Animation

This project provides an interactive animation of a carton packaging process. Users can view the transition from a 2D unfolded carton to a fully formed 3D package. The dimensions of the package, including height, width, and length, can be adjusted through the user interface. Additionally, the animation can be controlled using a slider.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Animation:** Watch the transformation of a 2D carton into a 3D package.
- **Adjustable Dimensions:** Modify the height, width, and length of the carton in real-time.
- **Slider Control:** Use a slider to control the folding and unfolding animation.
