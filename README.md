# Carton Packaging Animation

This project provides an interactive animation of a carton packaging process. Users can view the transition from a 2D unfolded carton to a fully formed 3D package. The dimensions of the package, including height, width, and length, can be adjusted through the user interface. Additionally, the animation can be controlled using a slider.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Animation:** Watch the transformation of a 2D carton into a 3D package.
- **Adjustable Dimensions:** Modify the height, width, and length of the carton in real-time.
- **Slider Control:** Use a slider to control the folding and unfolding animation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/carton-packaging-animation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd carton-packaging-animation
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Usage

- Adjust the dimensions of the carton using the input fields provided in the UI.
- Use the slider to control the folding and unfolding animation of the carton.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** For the structure and styling of the UI.
- **JavaScript:** To handle the logic for changing dimensions and controlling animations.
- **THREE.js:** For rendering and animating the 3D carton model.
- **SVG:** To create and manipulate the 2D representation of the unfolded carton.
